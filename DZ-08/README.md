# Classes and Objects

## Week : 8

Each student completes two tasks from the list. Other tasks can be used for practice and exam preparation, but you don't
submit them for review by assistants.

Formula for selecting the 1st task: 2378 % 25 + 1 = 4 - the student completes task 4

Formula for selecting the 2nd task: 2378 % 30 + 1 = 9 - the student completes task 9

## Task 1

- Task Index 5726 % 25 + 1 = `2`.
- Task description:

```text
Define a class named "Arrangement" that contains the following data: agency name, hotel name, location, number of nights, and arrangement price. 
Write a function named "average" to calculate the average price per night.
In the main function, load several arrangements and store them in an array. 
Calculate and print the average obtained. Store the class data in the private section and class methods (get/set methods for accessing private members, and other methods) in the public section.

Place the class declaration in a header file (e.g., Arrangement.h), and write the definitions of class member functions in a file named Arrangement.cpp.
For the class, create a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a copy constructor. 
Implement the parameterized constructor using the this pointer.
Provide an example of a parameterized constructor that uses an initialization list. 
Create a destructor for the class that prints the message "Object is destroyed".

Write the main program in the main.cpp file.
```

### Usage

* Run the program.

## Task 2

    - Task description:

```text
Write a program that reads 4 strings: str1, str2, str3, and str4. Determine the following:
a) String s5 obtained by removing the first occurrence of string s1 from s2
b) String s6 obtained by removing the first occurrence of string s3 from s4
c) Check if the strings s5 and s6 are equal and display the corresponding message on the screen.
```
