# Object-Oriented Principles of C++

## Week : 9

Each student completes one task from the list. Other tasks can be used for practice and exam preparation, but you don't
submit them for review by assistants.

Formula for selecting the task: 2378 % 20 + 1 = 19 - the student completes task 19

## Task

- Task Index 5726 % 20 + 1 = `7`.
- Task description:

```text
Create a complex number class that has real and imaginary parts as fields, a method to calculate the modulus of the complex number, and a method to calculate the conjugate complex number.
Create functions that add, multiply, and subtract two complex numbers. In the main program, create two complex numbers z and w and test the functions on them.
Store the class data in the private section and class methods (get/set methods for accessing private members, and other methods) in the public section. Create friend functions that serve as setter methods.

Declare the class in a header file (e.g., ComplexNumber.h) and define the class member functions in a file named ComplexNumber.cpp. Write the main program in the main.cpp file.

Create a static member (in the private section) to serve as information about the number of created objects.
Create a destructor in which this static member is decremented by one when the object is destroyed.
Create a static function getNumberOfObjects that accesses this static member and prints information about the current number of created objects.

Create overloaded addition (+), subtraction (-), and assignment (=) operators for class objects. Create overloaded operators that allow input (>>) and output (<<) of objects to be printed on the screen.
```

### Usage

* Run the program.
