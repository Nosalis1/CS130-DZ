# Arrays and Strings

## Week : 3

Each student completes two tasks from the list. Other tasks can be used for practice and exam preparation, but you don't
submit them for review by assistants.

Formula for selecting the 1st task: 2378 % 15 + 1 = 9 - the student completes task 9

Formula for selecting the 2nd task: 2378 % 15 + 16 = 24 - the student completes task 24

## Task 1

- Task Index 5726 % 15 + 1 = `12`.
- Task description:

```text
Form an array A[] of n randomly selected elements from the interval 0-100.
Divide such an array into two arrays: 
    array B[] contains elements less than 50
    array C[] contains the remaining elements.
```

### Usage
