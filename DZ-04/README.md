# Pointers

## Week : 4

Each student completes two tasks from the list. Other tasks can be used for practice and exam preparation, but you don't
submit them for review by assistants.

Formula for selecting the 1st task: 2378 % 20 + 1 = 19 - the student completes task 19

Formula for selecting the 2nd task: 2378 % 20 + 21 = 39 - the student completes task 39

## Task 1

- Task Index 5726 % 20 + 1 = `12`.
- Task description:

```text
Write a function void sum_of_divisors(int n, int *); which calculates the sum of divisors of the number n.
Then, in the main function, input the number k and display on the screen the sum of divisors of each number from the interval from 1 to k.
```

### Usage

* Input: 5
    * Output:
      ```text
      Sum of divisors of 1 is 0
      Sum of divisors of 2 is 1
      Sum of divisors of 3 is 1
      Sum of divisors of 4 is 3
      Sum of divisors of 5 is 1
      ```

## Task 1

- Task Index 5726 % 20 + 21 = `27`.
- Task description:

```text
Write a function that returns a pointer to a string containing the substring of the given string s that precedes the first occurrence of the specified substring.
Implement the function using only pointers.
```

### Usage

* Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    * Output:
      ```text
      String: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
      Substring: fox
      Substring found: The quick brown
      ```
