# Conditional statements and loops, Functions

## Week : 2

Each student completes two tasks from the list. Other tasks can be used for practice and exam preparation, but you don't
submit them for review by assistants.

Formula for selecting the 1st task: 1 + 2378 % 21 = 6 - the student completes task 6

Formula for selecting the 2nd task: 22 + 2378 % 19 = 25 - the student completes task 25

## Task 1

- Task Index 1 + 5726 % 21 = `15`.
- Task description:

```text
Write a program that randomly selects integers from the interval 0 - 999, displays the selected number,
and stops selecting numbers when the selected number is 500 or when the selection has been made more than 1000 times.
Use the rand() function from the stdlib.h library.
```

### Usage

* Run the program.

## Task 2

- Task Index 22 + 5726 % 19 = `29`.
- Task description:
```text
Write a logical function that determines whether the sum of the digits of an integer is even.
Test the function in the main program.
```

### Usage

* Input: 123456789
    * Output:
      ```text
      Sum of odd digits: 123456789 is odd
      ```

* Input: 987654321
    * Output:
      ```text
      Sum of odd digits: 987654321 is odd
