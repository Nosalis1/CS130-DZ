## Description

#### 15
    Write a program that randomly selects integers from the interval 0 - 999, displays the selected number,
    and stops selecting numbers when the selected number is 500 or when the selection has been made more than 1000 times.
    Use the rand() function from the stdlib.h library.

#### 29
    Write a logical function that determines whether the sum of the digits of an integer is even.
    Test the function in the main program.

## Requirements

- A C compiler such as GCC or Clang.
- Basic knowledge of C programming language.

## Usage

To use this program:
